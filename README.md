# Explanation Of Chatbot:

**Imagine This:**

You're building a chatbot for Panaversity. When a student opens the chatbot, it says:
“Welcome to the Panaversity AI Assistant! How can I help you today?”
And then it waits for the student's question and answers with Gemini 2.0 Flash model.

This code helps us build that chatbot using **Chainlit** (for the chat UI) and **Gemini AI** (for smart answers).

## Step-by-Step Breakdown
### 1. Import Required Tools

            import os
            from dotenv import load_dotenv
            from typing import cast
            import chainlit as cl
            from agents import Agent, Runner, AsyncOpenAI, OpenAIChatCompletionsModel
            from agents.run import RunConfig


* You’re bringing in all the necessary tools like:

 * os to read environment variables,

 * dotenv to load .env file (where your secret API key is saved),

 * chainlit to build the chatbot,

 * agents to use the OpenAI SDK with Gemini.


### 2. Load the API Key

            load_dotenv()
            gemini_api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")

* You're saying: “Go read my .env file and fetch my Gemini API key.”


        if not gemini_api_key:
            raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY is not set.")
            
* If the key isn’t found, stop and show an error — because without it, Gemini won’t work.


### 3. Start Chat Session

            @cl.on_chat_start
            async def start():

* This function runs when the chat first opens.

* Think of it like saying: “Okay, the student just joined. Let’s greet them and prepare everything.”

            external_client = AsyncOpenAI(
                    api_key=gemini_api_key,
                    base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/",
                )

* Here, we connect to Google’s Gemini API using the OpenAI-style SDK.


            model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
                    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                    openai_client=external_client
                )

* You're telling the app: “Use the Gemini 2.0 Flash model to answer questions.”


                config = RunConfig(
                    model=model,
                    model_provider=external_client,
                    tracing_disabled=True
                )

* RunConfig just gives some settings like turning off tracing (which is used for debugging or logging runs).


                cl.user_session.set("chat_history", [])
                cl.user_session.set("config", config)

* Saving settings and chat history per user, so every person has their own session.

            agent: Agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant", model=model)
                cl.user_session.set("agent", agent)

* You’re creating the actual AI assistant that will talk to the user.

             await cl.Message(content="Welcome to the Panaversity AI Assistant!").send()

* Sends the welcome message to the chat.

### 4. When User Sends a Message

            @cl.on_message
            async def main(message: cl.Message):

* This function runs when someone types a message in the chat.

            msg = cl.Message(content="Thinking...")
            await msg.send()

* A placeholder message: “I'm thinking…”


            agent: Agent = cast(Agent, cl.user_session.get("agent"))
                config: RunConfig = cast(RunConfig, cl.user_session.get("config"))

* Get the AI assistant and settings that we saved earlier.

                history = cl.user_session.get("chat_history") or []
                history.append({"role": "user", "content": message.content})

* Save what the user just said into the conversation history.

### 5. Run the Assistant

            result = Runner.run_sync(starting_agent=agent, input=history, run_config=config)
            response_content = result.final_output

* This line actually sends the full chat history to Gemini and waits for a reply.

                msg.content = response_content
                await msg.update()

* Update the “Thinking…” message with Gemini’s reply.

            cl.user_session.set("chat_history", result.to_input_list())

* Save the updated chat so the assistant remembers the conversation.

                print(f"User: {message.content}")
                print(f"Assistant: {response_content}")

* Just for logging: it prints what the user and assistant said.


### 6. Error Handling

            except Exception as e:
            msg.content = f"Error: {str(e)}"
            await msg.update()
            print(f"Error: {str(e)}")

* If something goes wrong (e.g., no internet or bad API key), it shows an error message.

## Real World Analogy
Imagine you're building a digital assistant for a university help desk:

 * A student says: “What are the class timings for AI course?”

 * The chatbot forwards the full conversation history to Google Gemini using your secret key.

 * Gemini understands and replies: “Classes are from 10am to 12pm, Monday to Thursday.”

 * The chat window updates from “Thinking…” to that answer.




 # Explain by another way

## Big Picture: What is This Code Doing?
You’re building a chatbot using:

 * Chainlit: This gives you a beautiful chat interface in the browser (like ChatGPT).

 * Gemini (from Google): This is your AI brain that thinks and responds to user questions.

 * OpenAI SDK: Gemini gives responses using a format similar to OpenAI, so the OpenAI-style client works here.

 * Python async: Since chatting involves waiting (like for Gemini’s response), we use async to avoid freezing the app.


## Step 1: Import Required Modules

                
                import os
                from dotenv import load_dotenv
                from typing import cast
                import chainlit as cl
                from agents import Agent, Runner, AsyncOpenAI, OpenAIChatCompletionsModel
                from agents.run import RunConfig


### What’s Happening?
* os: To work with your operating system (like reading environment variables).

* load_dotenv: Loads secrets like API keys from .env file (you don’t want to write keys in code!).

* cast: Helps Python know the type of a value (we’ll explain this when we use it below).

* chainlit: The tool that shows the chat UI in your browser.

* agents: This gives you:

  * Agent: Represents your AI helper (like “Assistant”).

  * Runner: Sends messages to the AI and gets replies.

  * AsyncOpenAI: Helps us connect to Gemini.

  * OpenAIChatCompletionsModel: A wrapper to use Gemini as if it’s OpenAI.

* RunConfig: A config object that we pass when we run the AI.



## Step 2: Load the API Key Securely

            load_dotenv()
            gemini_api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")

* You don’t want to write your API key in code (that’s unsafe).

* You save it in a .env file like this:


        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here

Then load_dotenv() loads it into memory, and os.getenv() fetches it.


            if not gemini_api_key:
                raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY is not set.")

If the key is missing, the app stops. Better to fail early than crash later.


## Step 3: Start the Chat Session

                @cl.on_chat_start
                async def start():

This function runs when the user first opens the chat. You use it to:

* Connect to Gemini

* Set up your AI assistant

* Say “Welcome!”


### Create Gemini Client

            external_client = AsyncOpenAI(
                api_key=gemini_api_key,
                base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/",
            )

This connects to Gemini API using a format like OpenAI’s.

We use AsyncOpenAI because the communication is asynchronous (non-blocking).


### Tell Which Model to Use

                
                model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
                    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                    openai_client=external_client
                )

Here, you choose the specific model: gemini-2.0-flash — fast and smart!


### Create Configuration

                    config = RunConfig(
                     model=model,
                     model_provider=external_client,
                     tracing_disabled=True
                    )

This sets up some configuration for how the AI will run.

* **model:** Which brain to use.

* **model_provider:** The client we created above.

* **tracing_disabled=True:** Means you’re not logging the chat flow (useful in dev to reduce overhead).


### Save Things in User Session

            cl.user_session.set("chat_history", [])
            cl.user_session.set("config", config)

* user_session is like a little notepad that remembers things per user.

* We store the chat history (what the user said) and the config.


            agent: Agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant", model=model)
            cl.user_session.set("agent", agent)

We create an AI Assistant object that knows its name, its job, and which model to use.



### Send Welcome Message

                await cl.Message(content="Welcome to the Panaversity AI Assistant!").send()

When the chat starts, it sends a warm welcome.



## Step 4: Handle User Messages

                    
                    @cl.on_message
                    async def main(message: cl.Message):

This function runs every time a user types a message.

### Show "Thinking..." Message

            msg = cl.Message(content="Thinking...")
            await msg.send()

This lets the user know the bot is working on a response.


### Retrieve Agent and Config

            agent: Agent = cast(Agent, cl.user_session.get("agent"))
            config: RunConfig = cast(RunConfig, cl.user_session.get("config"))

Now here's your question:

### What is cast? Why do we use it here?
In Python, when you retrieve something from user_session.get(), Python doesn’t know its type anymore — it sees it as a generic Any type.

That’s a problem if you want code suggestions or safety.

So cast(Agent, ...) tells Python:

 “Hey! Trust me, this thing is an Agent, not just some random data.”

It helps with type checking and autocomplete in editors like VS Code.


### Update the Chat History

            history = cl.user_session.get("chat_history") or []
            history.append({"role": "user", "content": message.content})

* Get previous messages.

* Add this new message to the history.


### Run the Agent and Get Response

                result = Runner.run_sync(
                 starting_agent=agent,
                 input=history,
                 run_config=config
                )
This sends the full chat to the AI and waits for a response.

 * input=history: So Gemini knows the conversation so far.

 * run_config=config: Uses Gemini Flash with no tracing.



            response_content = result.final_output

This is Gemini’s actual answer.


### Send Back the Answer

        msg.content = response_content
        await msg.update()

Update the “Thinking…” message with the real answer.


### Save Updated History

            cl.user_session.set("chat_history", result.to_input_list())

So next time the assistant knows what has already been said.


### Log the Chat

            print(f"User: {message.content}")
            print(f"Assistant: {response_content}")

Print it in your terminal (for developers).



### Handle Errors

                except Exception as e:
                    msg.content = f"Error: {str(e)}"
                    await msg.update()
                    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")

If anything crashes (like a bad API key), you show an error instead of breaking the app.


## Real World Analogy:
Think of this like a customer service chatbot:

1. When someone joins, it says:

 “Hello! How can I help you?”

2. When the person types something like:

 “What’s the fee structure?”

3. Your bot (Gemini) reads the full chat and gives a smart reply:

 “The total fee for the program is PKR 20,000.”

And it remembers what’s been said, so it can carry a smart, flowing conversation.


# Now Questions related to this code 

## Q:NO:1
            Explain this how its work because its in a variable msg than where this variable implement 
            msg = cl.Message(content="Thinking...")
                await msg.send()


### The Code:

            msg = cl.Message(content="Thinking...")
            await msg.send()

This small piece of code is super important for giving feedback to the user while the AI is thinking.

Let’s break it down word by word.

###  Line 1: msg = cl.Message(content="Thinking...")

#### What’s Happening Here?

You are creating a message object (but not showing it yet).

* cl.Message() is like saying:

  “Hey Chainlit, I want to create a message.”

* content="Thinking..." is what the message will say.

* You store it in a variable called msg, so you can use it later (like edit or update it).

###  Real-World Analogy:
Imagine a chatbot in a website where you see this:

 Bot: "Thinking..."

That little message gives you the feeling that:

 “Okay, the AI is working on my question, it hasn’t frozen.”

You just created that "Thinking..." message, but you haven’t displayed it yet.                

### Line 2: await msg.send()
#### What’s Happening Here?
Now you're saying:

 “Chainlit, go ahead and send this message to the user interface — show the user that the bot is thinking.”

  * await is used because sending takes a bit of time (maybe a second), so we say:

   “Wait here, but don’t freeze the whole app.”

This actually displays the “Thinking…” message on the screen.


### So what is msg used for after this?

You saved the message in a variable called msg so that later you can update it with the final AI response instead of creating a new message.

#### Look at this part from later in the code:


            msg.content = response_content
            await msg.update()

Here’s what’s happening:

1. First you created:


            msg = cl.Message(content="Thinking...")
            await msg.send()

So the screen shows:

 Bot: Thinking...

2. Then, after you get Gemini’s real response, you say:


            msg.content = "Yes, the fee is PKR 20,000"
            await msg.update()
Now the screen changes that message to:

Bot: Yes, the fee is PKR 20,000            



### Why reuse the same msg instead of sending a new one?

There are 2 big benefits:

#### 1. Looks Cleaner
Instead of this:



                Bot: Thinking...
                Bot: Yes, the fee is PKR 20,000

You get this:

                Bot: Yes, the fee is PKR 20,00
                
The “Thinking…” message disappears and gets replaced. Cleaner UI!

#### 2. Gives Feedback

If the AI takes a few seconds to respond, the user sees the “Thinking…” message and knows it’s working — better user experience.

### Final Recap:

            msg = cl.Message(content="Thinking...")  # Create the placeholder message
            await msg.send()                         # Show it in the chat UI

Then later:

            msg.content = response_content           # Replace the content with real AI response
            await msg.update()                       # Update the message in the UI

## Real-Life Example:
Let’s say you’re chatting with a bank assistant bot:

**You:**
 What is my account balance?

**Bot:**
 Thinking... ← (msg.send())

...2 seconds later...

**Bot:**
 Your balance is PKR 10,000 ← (msg.update())

That’s exactly what you’re building!



# Question No : 2
## What does this code do?

                agent: Agent = cast(Agent, cl.user_session.get("agent"))
                    config: RunConfig = cast(RunConfig, cl.user_session.get("config"))

                    # Retrieve the chat history from the session.
                    history = cl.user_session.get("chat_history") or []
                    
                    # Append the user's message to the history.
                    history.append({"role": "user", "content": message.content})
    


### Here's the code block:

                agent: Agent = cast(Agent, cl.user_session.get("agent"))
                config: RunConfig = cast(RunConfig, cl.user_session.get("config"))

                # Retrieve the chat history from the session.
                history = cl.user_session.get("chat_history") or []

                # Append the user's message to the history.
                history.append({"role": "user", "content": message.content})



## Step-by-step Breakdown
### 1. user_session – What is it?
In Chainlit, each person chatting with the bot gets their own session (think of it like their personal conversation space).

You can store and retrieve values (like memory) in it using:

                cl.user_session.set("something", value)
                cl.user_session.get("something")

Think of it like a drawer where you're storing things for that specific user.


## Now Let’s Break the Code Line-by-Line:

### Line 1:

                agent: Agent = cast(Agent, cl.user_session.get("agent"))

What it’s doing:
* It's saying:

  “From the session memory, get the thing called agent.”

* This agent is an instance of your AI assistant, which was created earlier when the chat started.

**Why use cast(Agent, ...)?**
Python is dynamically typed, which means it doesn’t strictly know what type something is unless you tell it.

So cast(Agent, ...) tells Python:

 “Hey! Trust me, I know this is an Agent.”

It helps with autocompletion, type checking, and avoids warnings in your editor.

**Real-world example:**

Think of it like opening your drawer and saying:

 “This item is a calculator (Agent), not just some random object.”


### Line 2:

            config: RunConfig = cast(RunConfig, cl.user_session.get("config"))

### What’s happening?
You’re doing the same thing as line 1 — but this time you’re retrieving the AI's configuration (settings like model, API client, and whether tracing is enabled).

You stored this earlier in user_session.set("config", config) during @cl.on_chat_start.


### Line 3:

            history = cl.user_session.get("chat_history") or []

### What it means:
* You're retrieving the conversation history (a list of messages exchanged).

* If there’s nothing yet, it uses an empty list [] as a default.

#### Real-world analogy:
You're opening your chat notebook. If the notebook is empty (first message), you just create a new one.


### Line 4:

            history.append({"role": "user", "content": message.content})

#### What’s going on:
 * You’re adding the user’s latest message to the chat history.

 * The message has two parts:

  * "role": "user" → who sent it

  * "content": message.content" → what the user said

#### Real-world analogy:
You write a new line in your notebook:

 **User:** "What is the course fee?"

Now, the notebook looks like:


            [
             {"role": "user", "content": "What is the course fee?"}
            ]


### Visual Breakdown Summary:

                agent = get the assistant model
                config = get the AI's model + settings
                history = get old messages
                history.append = add new user message


## Why is this important?
This setup helps you:

1. Access the same agent and config every time the user sends a message.

2. Keep the full conversation history, which is super important for contextual answers.

 * Example: If the user says:

   “What’s the fee?”
   The AI will understand “fee” refers to the course because the earlier messages gave context.               



# Question NO 3:
## What does this do:

            agent: Agent = cast(Agent, cl.user_session.get("agent"))


## 1. The agent (right side) — What is cl.user_session.get("agent")?
Earlier in your code (inside @cl.on_chat_start), you had this:


            agent: Agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant", model=model)
            cl.user_session.set("agent", agent)
This means:

* You created an Agent (your AI assistant).

* You stored that assistant inside the user's session (like putting it in a drawer).

* You labeled it "agent" so you can find it later.

Now, in the on_message function (when the user sends a message), you want to get that same AI assistant back from the drawer using:

                cl.user_session.get("agent")



## 2. What is cast(Agent, ...) doing?
The function cl.user_session.get(...) just returns a general object — Python doesn’t know what exact type it is.

So we use:

            cast(Agent, cl.user_session.get("agent"))

This tells Python and your code editor:

 “Hey, treat this thing I got from the drawer as an Agent type.”

Why this matters:

* Helps with autocompletion in code editors (e.g., .run(), .name)

* Helps TypeScript-style type checking

* Makes your code cleaner and safer


## 3. Left side: agent: Agent = ... — what’s going on?
You're saying:

 * “I'm creating a variable named agent.”

 * “It should be of type Agent.”

 * “I’m getting it from the session and making sure Python knows it's an Agent.”

So now you can use agent in your code to make your assistant do stuff — like generate replies based on user input.


## Real World Analogy
Let’s say you are the teacher of a classroom AI assistant project.

1. You assigned a helper (AI assistant) to each student and gave each helper a name.

2. You stored their helper's information inside the student's drawer, labeled "agent".

3. Later, when the student asks a question, you go to their drawer and pull out their assistant to help them answer.

But you tell yourself:

    “Hmm, this looks like the right thing — but just to be safe, let me make sure I’m holding an Assistant and not something else.”

That's what cast(Agent, ...) is doing.


### Putting it Together Visually

            # You earlier stored it like this:
            cl.user_session.set("agent", my_ai_assistant)

            # Later you retrieve it:
            agent: Agent = cast(Agent, cl.user_session.get("agent"))

Now you can safely use:


            result = Runner.run_sync(starting_agent = agent, ...)



### Bonus: What is an Agent?
An Agent is like your personal AI assistant.

When you write:


            Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant", model=model)

You're creating an assistant that:

* Has a name

* Has instructions (its job description)

* Uses a specific model (like Gemini)


# Question No 4:
 ## “If I already wrote config: RunConfig, then Python already knows it’s a RunConfig, right? So why do I still need to cast it?”

 ### 1. Why do we need cast() even if we wrote config: RunConfig?
Because cl.user_session.get("config") is a generic function.

That means it returns an object, but Python doesn't know what type it is — it could be anything: a string, a number, an agent, a potato...

So even if you say:


            config: RunConfig = cl.user_session.get("config")

Python will give you a warning like:

    “Hey, I don’t really know if this thing you're pulling from the session is truly a RunConfig. Are you sure?”

To make Python sure and confident, you have to be more explicit, like:


            config: RunConfig = cast(RunConfig, cl.user_session.get("config"))

This is your way of saying:

    “Yes, Python, I promise that what I’m pulling is a RunConfig. Trust me.”



### 2. Why cast() is needed — Real World Analogy
Imagine this:

You're taking something out of a mystery box (the user session). You think it’s a laptop, so you try to plug in a charger.

But the box could have had:

* A laptop

* A book

* A sandwich

If you plug a charger into a sandwich — boom! It won’t work.

So you say:

  “Let me clearly say: I’m treating this as a laptop.”

That’s exactly what cast(RunConfig, ...) does. It tells Python:

  “Yes, this mystery item from the session is definitely a RunConfig — go ahead and treat it that way.”


### 3. What happens if we don’t use cast()?
If you skip cast, like this:


        config = cl.user_session.get("config")

* Your editor (like VS Code or PyCharm) will not give you code suggestions like config.model or config.tracing_disabled

* Python won't raise an error right away — but if you try to use it wrong, you might get runtime errors

* It's like walking in the dark — risky 


### Final Recap:

**config: RunConfig = ...**
 * You're creating a variable and saying “This should be a RunConfig.”
**cl.user_session.get("config")**	
 * Gets something from the user's session — but Python doesn’t know the type.
**cast(RunConfig, ...)**
 * You're telling Python: “This thing is a RunConfig — trust me.”


# Question No 5:
## What does this code do?

            history = cl.user_session.get("chat_history") or []
            Where the "chat_history" come from

            history.append({"role": "user", "content": message.content})
            from where message.content come from and why not it is in the ""    




### 1. Where does chat_history come from?
**Code:**

            history = cl.user_session.get("chat_history") or []

**Explanation:**
The "chat_history" is a key we used earlier when the user first starts a chat.

Here’s where we created it:

                cl.user_session.set("chat_history", [])
This line says:

        “Let’s store an empty chat history list into the session. The key is 'chat_history' and the value is an empty list [].”

So what does this do?

            history = cl.user_session.get("chat_history") or []
This means:

    “Try to get the chat history from the user session. If it's None (like if it doesn't exist), then just use an empty list [] as a fallback.”

So you never get an error — it always gives you a list, even if chat history wasn't there before.



### 2. Where does message.content come from?
**Code:**

        history.append({"role": "user", "content": message.content})
Let's break it down:
In the function:

            @cl.on_message
            async def main(message: cl.Message):

* The message variable is automatically passed in by Chainlit when a user sends a message.

* It is an instance of cl.Message, which is a special object provided by Chainlit.

* message.content is the actual text the user typed in the chat.

**Example:**
Let’s say the user typed:

                "What's the weather today?"
Then:

                message.content  ===  "What's the weather today?"

We don’t write it in quotes because it’s a variable, not hardcoded text. If you wrote:


                "message.content"

...then Python would treat it like the actual string "message.content", which is wrong.


### 3. What does this line do?

                history.append({"role": "user", "content": message.content})
It means:

    “Add this new user message to the chat history.”

So after a few messages, your history might look like this:


[
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi! How can I help?"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather today?"}
]

The "role" tells the model who said the message (user or assistant), and "content" is the actual message.



## Final Summary:

**"chat_history"**	
 * A key used to store the conversation so far in the session.

**cl.user_session.get()**	
 * Gets a value (like chat history) from the session.

**or []**	
 * If the value is None, use an empty list instead.

**message.content**	
 * The actual text the user typed in the chat.

**history.append({...})**	
 * Adds a new user message to the conversation history.



 # Question No 6:
 ## How try and except Work in Asynchronous Functions:
 In Python, try and except are used to handle exceptions (errors) that might occur during code execution. These blocks are a way to catch and handle errors gracefully, without the program crashing.

Using try and except in Async Functions:
* Inside asynchronous functions, you can perform tasks that take time, like making API calls, waiting for user inputs, or  
  processing data.

* If anything goes wrong while performing those tasks, the except block can catch the error and handle it without stopping the  
  entire program.

When using await inside an async function, the code execution will wait for that task to complete before moving on. If an error occurs during this wait, the except block can catch it.

Here’s a simplified version of how this works:

**Example:**

                import asyncio

                async def example_function():
                    try:
                        print("Starting process...")
                        # Simulate a task that could raise an exception
                        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # This is just a placeholder for async tasks
                        raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")
                        print("This will not be printed.")
                    except ValueError as e:
                        print(f"Caught an error: {e}")
                    finally:
                        print("Execution complete.")

                    # Run the async function
                    asyncio.run(example_function())

### Explanation of the Code:
1. try block:

 * In the try block, you place the code that might raise an exception. In this case, we simulate an error by raising a ValueError.

2. await keyword:

 * We use await here to simulate an asynchronous task (asyncio.sleep(1)) that takes time, like making an API call or waiting for a response. If an error occurs during this process, it can be caught by the except block.

3. except block:

* If the error happens (in our case, the ValueError), the except block is executed, and the error is handled without crashing  
  the program.

4. finally block:

* The finally block is optional. It runs no matter what, and it's useful for cleanup tasks, like closing connections or logging  
  that the execution has completed.


### How It Works in Your Code:
In your case, the try block is used to:

* Call the agent to get a response.

* Handle any potential errors that might occur during that process (like network issues, API errors, or bad inputs).

If something goes wrong in this part of the code, the except block will catch the error and provide feedback to the user, instead of the whole program crashing.

Here’s the part from your code for reference:


                try:
                    print("\n[CALLING_AGENT_WITH_CONTEXT]\n", history, "\n")
                    result = Runner.run_sync(starting_agent=agent, input=history, run_config=config)
                    
                    response_content = result.final_output
                    
                    # Update the thinking message with the actual response
                    msg.content = response_content
                    await msg.update()

                    # Update the session with the new history.
                    cl.user_session.set("chat_history", result.to_input_list())
                    
                    # Optional: Log the interaction
                    print(f"User: {message.content}")
                    print(f"Assistant: {response_content}")
                    
                except Exception as e:
                    msg.content = f"Error: {str(e)}"
                    await msg.update()
                    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")



### What Happens Here:
* The try block:

  * It executes the code that might raise an exception. In this case, it runs the agent (Runner.run_sync), updates the message,  
   and logs the interaction.

  * If everything goes well, the response from the agent is shown to the user.

* The except block:

  * If any error occurs (for example, if the API request fails, or there’s a network issue), the except block catches it.
 
  * The error message is displayed to the user, and it’s logged for debugging purposes.

### Why Use try and except in Async Functions?
 * Prevent Program Crashes: Without error handling, if something goes wrong, the whole program might crash. By using try and except, you can catch errors and continue the program’s flow smoothly.

 * Graceful Error Handling: It allows you to provide useful error messages to users (instead of a crash), and optionally log errors for debugging.

#### Real-World Example:
Imagine you're ordering food from a restaurant (like in a chatbot scenario):

1. User: Sends a message, and the system starts preparing the response (async).

2. System: While preparing the response, if there’s an error (like the kitchen is closed or ingredients are missing), the system 
   catches the error (inside the except block) and tells the user: "Sorry, there's an issue with your order."

Without the try and except, the user would just get an error, and the system might crash.



## Conclusion:
Yes, try and except are fully usable inside asynchronous functions. They allow you to handle errors gracefully, whether you’re waiting for a task to finish asynchronously or handling user input. This approach ensures that your program remains robust and doesn't crash when something goes wrong during asynchronous operations.

# Question No 6 
## Can we use sync inside asynchronous


### Running Synchronous Code Inside Asynchronous Functions:
It’s common to see synchronous code being called inside an asynchronous function. The key is understanding that:

* Asynchronous code is great for tasks that involve waiting (like I/O operations: reading files, network requests, etc.), but    
  synchronous code still works fine in async functions, as long as the synchronous code doesn't block the execution.

* If you have a synchronous function that doesn't involve waiting or blocking (like simple calculations), running it inside an  
  asynchronous function is completely fine.

### Example of Running Synchronous Code in an Asynchronous Function:
Let’s say you want to calculate the sum of two numbers in a synchronous function, but you're still doing other asynchronous tasks around it.

                import asyncio

                # This is a synchronous function
                def sync_function():
                    return 10 + 20

                # This is an asynchronous function
                async def async_function():
                    print("Before sync task")
                    
                    # Running the sync function inside async
                    result = sync_function()
                    print(f"Result of sync function: {result}")
                    
                    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulating an async task
                    
                    print("After async task")

                # Running the async function
                asyncio.run(async_function())


### Explanation:
* The sync_function is a regular synchronous function. It computes the sum of two numbers and returns it.

* Inside the async_function, we call the synchronous function sync_function just like we would in any regular Python code.

* Even though the function is async, calling synchronous code inside it works perfectly fine. However, notice that while  
  synchronous code runs, it doesn't "wait" or "block" other asynchronous tasks from running. So, after running the synchronous code, the program proceeds to the await asyncio.sleep(2) which simulates an asynchronous task.


### Example in Your Code Context:
In the code you provided:

            result = Runner.run_sync(starting_agent=agent, input=history, run_config=config)

* Runner.run_sync() is a synchronous function, which means it will run synchronously and wait for the result before continuing 
  to the next line of code.

* Even though you're in an asynchronous function (the one with async def main()), you're calling a synchronous function 
  (run_sync). This works because the function run_sync is just a regular Python function, not an async task.

* The difference is, once run_sync completes and returns the result, you continue running the remaining asynchronous code, like  
  updating the message (await msg.update()), because asynchronous code doesn't block other parts of the program from running.  


### Important Notes:
1. Blocking Operations in Async Functions:

* If you call a long-running synchronous function inside an asynchronous function, it can block the event loop, which means   
  other asynchronous tasks cannot run until it’s done. This defeats the purpose of using async/await.

* If you have a long-running synchronous function, consider running it in a separate thread or process to avoid blocking the  
   event loop.

2. Mixing Async and Sync:

* It’s fine to mix both async and sync code, but be mindful of when and how long synchronous tasks take. If they are blocking (e.
  g., a time-consuming calculation or file I/O), they may reduce the performance benefits of using async.

#### Real-World Example:
Let’s consider a real-world example where you have an asynchronous chat application, and you want to fetch some data from an API and perform a calculation while waiting for the response.  


        import asyncio

        # Synchronous function for calculation
        def calculate_price(price, tax_rate):
            return price + (price * tax_rate)

        # Asynchronous function for API request
        async def fetch_data():
            print("Fetching data from API...")
            await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate API delay
            print("Data fetched!")

        # Main async function
        async def main():
            print("Starting process...")
            
            # Call the synchronous function while waiting for the async task
            price = 100
            tax_rate = 0.05
            total_price = calculate_price(price, tax_rate)
            print(f"Total price after tax: {total_price}")
            
            # Simulate waiting for an API call to complete
            await fetch_data()

        # Running the async function
        asyncio.run(main())


### In this example:

* calculate_price is synchronous and runs immediately without blocking.

* fetch_data is asynchronous and uses await to simulate waiting for an API call.

Here, the synchronous calculate_price function is executed while the program is "waiting" for the API request to complete.

## Conclusion:
Yes, you can absolutely run synchronous code inside an asynchronous function. The key takeaway is that as long as the synchronous task doesn’t block the event loop (i.e., doesn't take too long or use resources inefficiently), it's perfectly fine. However, if you're working with long-running synchronous operations, you might need to look into ways of handling those asynchronously to avoid blocking the program.
